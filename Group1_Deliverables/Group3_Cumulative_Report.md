Sub-problems: selecting sensor setup and designing speed control

For each of our sub-problems, we met as a group to discuss what our options were and what would be the best choice given the constraints on the size of the car and the difficulty of implementation, among other criteria. Initially it was difficult to think of enough options for each subproblem, which was problematic for the sensor selection subproblem in particular because using too many sensors can cause problems for the design of our sensor array and might make our car larger than the specified dimensions, but eventually we were able to find other options through research and comparing our car to online examples. 

This is reflected in our design journals from November 20 and November 25, which state, "We met as a group to discuss the sensor configuration and selection of sensors, and we decided on using 5 IR sensors as well as the ultrasonic and lidar sensors." and "We discussed how to tackle speed control as a group, and decided on using one encoder based on our design matrix for this subproblem."
