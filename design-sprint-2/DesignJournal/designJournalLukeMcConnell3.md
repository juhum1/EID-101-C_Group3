# EID-101 Group 3 - Luke McConnell
## Design Journal

### <u> Entry #1</u> (Week #1, Nov 7)
Used cardboard for base of car. Added Arduino Uno with sensor shield to the top right corner of the car. Fastened the wheels to the car. Wired the motors.

### <u> Entry #2</u> (Week #2, Nov 14)
Continued adding to the CAD of the car. Also wrote code for integrating the IR sensor. Had to tune potentiometer to make sure the car can stop 100 mm away from the wall.

### <u> Entry #3</u> (Week #3, Nov 21)
Added 2 more IR sensors to the car using screws and wired them. Added to CAD and adjusted placement since the sensors needed to be closer to the floor and the ball caster was also getting detected by the sensors.

### <u> Entry #4</u> (Week #4, Nov 27)
Worked on the 3D print and laser cut parts. This will help with keeping the sensors in place and also having easier Arduino access because right now, it is hard to plug into the Arduino since the wheel is in the way. Got the 3D printed part on Monday and the laser cut part today.
